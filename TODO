- Write a GStreamer sink element based on libam7xxx.
- Generate language bindings in order to use libam7xxx from other languages
  (this may not be necessary if the GStreamer sink works well enough).
- If there will ever be an API breakage, consider using more portable types
  (e.g.  off_t for file sizes, size_t for counters, etc.)
